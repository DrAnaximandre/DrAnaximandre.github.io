Summary: Hello world and advanced data science.
Status: published


Hello world. Nobody wants to see maths so I'm typing some text to hide the math. 
I'll talk about sets and stuff. And basic linear algebra. And advanced data science. 


This is advanced data science: $x+2$

And this is is another test: $$y\in A$$

Believe it or not, I did that with TensorFlow. Why won't this caption be where I want it to be ?

Changing another thing: this $x$.
And again. I change things to test the commits.
