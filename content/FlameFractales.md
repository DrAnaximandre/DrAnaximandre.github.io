Summary: This is the guidelines to use the code in the repo. It's also useful for me.


What is the purpose of this article?
------------------------------------

Mostly it's to help people use the code in the [repo](https://github.com/DrAnaximandre/FlamePython2).


What are Flames Fractals ?
--------------------------
The main reference is [Draves and Reckase](http://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf). You could read it through and through, but let me propose a shorter, simplified version.


Let us have a colored point, called Robert. Robert is a white point, with coordinates somewhere in $[-1, 1]^2$ (and RGB 255, 255, 255). Let us also have a function, $F$, that goes from $[-1, 1]^2 * [0,255]^3$ to $[-1, 1]^2 * [0,255]^3$. In other words, F_0 takes a colored point and return another colored point.

The result of inputing Robert into F will be denoted Robert_1, and you can also put Robert_1 into F, you'd get Robert_2.


I don't get it. Can you make another example?
---------------------------------------------

Sure!
